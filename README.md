Ship Load Balancer
This project is an algorithm-based software that optimizes the placement of cargo containers on a ship to ensure stability and even weight distribution. It generates a visual loading plan and step-by-step instructions for cargo crews.

Features

Optimal Placement Algorithm: A sophisticated algorithm calculates the best position for each container based on its weight, prioritizing even distribution between the ship's port and starboard sides for enhanced stability.

Interactive Ship Grid: The application provides a visual representation of the ship's deck, showing container placements.

Multiple View Modes: Switch between a "Balance View" and a "Weight Map" to visualize weight distribution and concentration.

Real-time Overload Detection: An "Overload Warning" is displayed if weight concentration in any grid cell exceeds a safe limit (e.g., 8000 kg).

Loading Instructions: The software generates a detailed, step-by-step list of instructions for placing each container.

Exportable Load Plan: A comprehensive report can be exported as a PDF, including the balance ratio and placement instructions.

Technologies Used

React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

Framer Motion: A production-ready animation library for React.

JavaScript: The core language for the application's logic.

CSS: For styling the components.

How to Run Locally

Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone [Your-Repository-URL]
Navigate to the project directory:

Bash

cd [Your-Project-Folder]
Install dependencies:

Bash

npm install
Start the development server:

Bash

npm start
Open your browser and visit http://localhost:3000.
Bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
### `npm run build`


Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
